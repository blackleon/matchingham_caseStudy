This is a case study project where I tried to clone "Food Match 3D: Tile Puzzle", a casual game relased by Matchingham Games.

There are 20 fruits implemented in the game. The game starts with 3 types of fruits at level 1 and reaches maximum amount at level 17.

Assets Used:
Dotween
Fruit Market (2.0)

Custom Packages:
cysharp.unitask
com.google (external dependency manager for unity)
